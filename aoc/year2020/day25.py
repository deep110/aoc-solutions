# Combo Breaker

The card loop size is found using the
[Baby-step giant-step algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baby-step_giant-step). This takes
only âˆš20201227 = 4495 steps, compared to potentially up to 20201227 steps for the brute force approach.
This reduced the runtime from 240ms to ~0.8ms

The method described to calculate encryption key is called [modular exponentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_exponentiation).
There are multiple ways to calculate it, one way is described in the problem. It takes around ~160ms
to calculate in first way. There is more efficient approach. We can use Right-to-left binary method
which uses [exponentiation by squaring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation_by_squaring). This
reduces the runtime to 0.26 ms.
